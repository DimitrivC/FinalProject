# Quiz

Interested in answering multiple choice quiz questions? With a very unfair score function that
makes it almost impossible to have a positive score for a longer period of time? (Some would say it 
is as unfair as RailNL's scorefunction). If you answer "yes" to both of these questions, than this
is the Android App for you!
